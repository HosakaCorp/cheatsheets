Cheatsheets
===========
A collection of my personal pentester oriented cheatsheets that target specific targets.

Some of the content is probably very similar on some of the OS targets, but the tools should targeted toward that specific OS.

List
----
* linux.md - A generic Linux cheatsheet containing an attempt at genericized information. Most information that is distro specific is called out
* openbsd.md - OpenBSD cheatsheet
